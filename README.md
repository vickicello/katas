## About this repository

This is a collection of simple programming exercises, based on https://adriann.github.io/programming_problems.html
I'm using these questions as a way to *actually* practice TDD and get better at 'building things from scratch' while also 
expanding my Ruby knowledge (and especially my pure, non-Rails flavored Ruby knowledge).
